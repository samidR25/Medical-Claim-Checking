## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-claim-checker.git
   cd medical-claim-checker
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv covid_env
   
   # On Linux/Mac
   source covid_env/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows
   covid_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

## 🔬 Counter-Claim Generation

### Enhancing Dataset

Navigate to the counter-claim generation directory and run:

```bash
cd counter-claim-generation
python enhance_covidfact_dataset.py
python evaluate_enhancement.py
```

### Usage Example

```python
from src.counter_claim_generation.improved_generator import ImprovedCounterClaimGenerator

# Initialize the generator with advanced features
generator = ImprovedCounterClaimGenerator(
    use_srl=True,                    # Semantic Role Labeling
    use_entity_sub=True,             # Entity Substitution
    use_quantity_mod=True,           # Quantity Modification
    use_span_replacement=True,       # Span Replacement
    use_dependency_structure=True,   # Dependency Structure Analysis
    contradiction_threshold=0.7      # Contradiction Detection Threshold
)

# Generate counter-claims
claim = "Masks are effective in preventing COVID-19 transmission"
counter_claims = generator.generate_counter_claims(claim, num_candidates=3)

for cc in counter_claims:
    print(f"🔹 Original: {claim}")
    print(f"🔸 Counter-claim: {cc['counter_claim']}")
    print(f"📋 Strategy: {cc['strategy']}")
    print(f"📊 Contradiction score: {cc['contradiction_score']:.2f}")
    print("─" * 60)
```

## ✅ Claim Verification

### Running the Verification Model

```bash
cd claim-verification
jupyter notebook notebooks/COVID-19_Claim_Verification.ipynb
```

### Usage Example

```python
from src.claim_verification.verifier import MedicalClaimVerifier

# Initialize and load pre-trained model
verifier = MedicalClaimVerifier.load("models/biobert_covid_claims")

# Verify claims
claims = ["Masks are effective in preventing COVID-19 transmission"]
results = verifier.predict(claims)

print(f"📋 Claim: {claims[0]}")
print(f"✅ Verification: {results['readable_predictions'][0]}")
# Output: ['SUPPORTED'] or ['REFUTED']
```
